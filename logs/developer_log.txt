Sentiment Analysis:

(2025.02.22, Yeye)
The server is a clickhouse DBMS. Difference between clickhouse and traditional MySQL server:

"The main difference between ClickHouse and MySQL 
is that ClickHouse is a columnar database optimized 
for high-performance analytics and large-scale 
data processing, while MySQL is a row-based 
relational database designed for transactional 
processing and smaller-scale applications."

use clickhouse_driver to connect to the server.
installation: 
pip install clickhouse-driver    # Native protocol (recommended for performance)
pip install clickhouse-connect   # HTTP/HTTPS protocol

## Testing for FinBERT
- tested for 10 news from our dataset by inputting the description of each news for sentiment analysis by FinBERT
- Generated sentiment analysis values columns: finbert_pos, finbert_neg, finbert_neu, finbert_sentiment, finbert_score
- finbert_pos, finbert_neg, finbert_neu are combined to have a score of 1
- finbert_score is calculated with: finbert_pos - finbert_neg
- finbert_score is in a range from -1 to 1 where -1 is extreme negative, 0 is netural, and 1 is extreme positive sentiment



ON SERVER 03 :
python3 --version   # checking python version on server, OUTPUT: Python 3.10.12

Then getting into SERVER 01 for checking the dataset:
