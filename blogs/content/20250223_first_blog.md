## Connect to the Server

The server is a clickhouse DBMS. Difference between clickhouse and traditional MySQL server:

"The main difference between ClickHouse and MySQL 
is that ClickHouse is a columnar database optimized 
for high-performance analytics and large-scale 
data processing, while MySQL is a row-based 
relational database designed for transactional 
processing and smaller-scale applications."

Use clickhouse_driver to connect to the server.

Installation: 
```python
pip install clickhouse-driver    # Native protocol (recommended for performance)
pip install clickhouse-connect   # HTTP/HTTPS protocol
```

We use codes below to connect to the server so that we can gain an accessment to our news data for afterwards steps. 
```python
client = Client(
    host=host_name,
    user=user_name,
    password=pswd,
    database=db_name,
    port=port,
)
```

Here is a snapshot of our news data:

## How to Include a Link and Python

We chose [Investing.com](http://www.investing.com) to get the whole
year data of XRP and recalculated the return and 30 days volatility.

myvar = 8
